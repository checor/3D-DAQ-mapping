# 3D-DAQ-mapping 
## Highly configurable test app

3D-DAQ-Mapping (3DM) aim to be a full featured test app that will help engineers to make temperature tests using DAQ.

Currently, development will be focused on a NI DAQ and for use in stove tests. Hopefully further development will expand these posibilities.
